## 💡 Why This Project Exists

Aquasana provides excellent documentation — but it can be difficult to find, download, and organize across dozens of product lines. Many PDFs are scattered across different pages, or embedded inside pop-ups and third-party portals.

This project solves that by:

- 📚 Collecting and curating _every_ available manual and data sheet
- 🧱 Organizing materials in a consistent, AI-friendly format
- 🔍 Enabling full-text search, classification, and metadata tagging
- 🌐 Making documentation accessible to those with limited connectivity or technical skill

We believe that:

> 🗃️ **Well-structured product documentation empowers users, enables AI development, and promotes better decision-making around water usage and filtration.**
